## 1. Introduction

Bloodmate is more than just a blood donation app. It is a community of people who care about each other and share their stories and needs. With Bloodmate, you can see who needs blood urgently and for what reason, and you can offer your help with a few taps. You can also request blood from other donors in your area if you or someone you love needs it. Bloodmate makes blood donation more personal, meaningful and rewarding.
