## 1. Introduction

Bloodmate is more than just a blood donation app. It is a community of people who care about each other and share their stories and needs. With Bloodmate, you can see who needs blood urgently and for what reason, and you can offer your help with a few taps. You can also request blood from other donors in your area if you or someone you love needs it. Bloodmate makes blood donation more personal, meaningful and rewarding. 

## 2. Key Features
### 2.1 Designated blood donation   

- You can post information such as the blood recipient, the type of blood needed, the reason, and the designated blood donation details.
- You can see the list of designated blood donations from your nearby neighbors filtered by distance, blood type and blood donation type.
    - If the hospital information where your neighbor patient is admitted is entered, you can visit the hospital directly and donate blood without going through a blood bank (this can help solve urgent situations that are related to life more quickly).
- The person who received your blood donation can send a thank-you message to you, like in Karrot Market reviews (you can also see this in your awards or profile page).

- You can make it possible for people who have rare types of blood (Rh-) to get a transfusion when they get injured worldwide.

### 2.2 Acquaintance blood donation
- You can automatically register your acquaintances (regardless of whether they registered for the app or not) by phone number.

- You can send or receive blood donation requests to your acquaintances when you need blood urgently.
- You can also send them to indirect acquaintances, not just direct ones.
    - Example: ‚ÄòHan Ji-sang, an acquaintance of your acquaintance Choi Yoon-ji, needs blood urgently.‚Äô

### 2.3 Guardian
- You can add up to 4 of your acquaintances who registered for the app as your guardians.
- If you're too damaged to use the app for requesting blood donation, your guardians can reqeust blood donation to your acquaintances instead.
- Likewise, you can be a guardian of someone at request.

## 3. Futer Development Plans

### 3.1 Community
1) Blood donation community

### 3.2 Blood donation awards

- A plaque that is sent to people who have donated blood once, three times, etc. to let them know that their act was very helpful and important.
